                <b>Details:</b>  My primary objective in this project is to develop a learning-based secure control framework for cyber-physical systems in the presence of sensor and actuator attacks. Specifically, we use a bank of observer-based estimators to detect the attacks while also  introducing a threat detection level function. Once the attack mitigation is triggered, a two-player, zero-sum differential game is formulated and the underlying joint state estimation and attack mitigation problem is solved by using a reinforcement learning algorithm. More details can refer to the papers in <A href="https://sjtunyujackzhou.github.io/zhou/publications.html">my publication page</A>. <br /><br />

                <b>Details:</b>  There are many potential examples of networked control systems in various application areas, such as smart power grids, intelligent traffic control systems, and so forth. With so many information collected from the communication network, control engineers can make precise and optimal control strategies emerging from intelligent control theory, starting from optimal control, adaptive control, robust control and many other advanced forms of control algorithms. However, applying all these control strategies over a network with so many sensors is a challenging task.<br /><br />

               This multi-disciplinary project has a major area of communications, networking and signal processing, which provides essential enabling and supporting technologies for different applications of dynamical networked systems. This project plans to develop the effective approaches and the core techniques that are available for analysis, optimization and implementation of the distributed networked control systems. To ensure industrial relevance and impact, the advisors have established collaborations with many industrial partners to demonstrate these new approaches, e.g. large-scale electric power networks and large-scale, integrated water-saving irrigation systems.
